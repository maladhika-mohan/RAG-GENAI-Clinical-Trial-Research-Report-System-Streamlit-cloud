Clinical Trial: Aspirin for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention
Study ID: NCT12345678
Phase: III
Status: Completed

BACKGROUND:
Aspirin has been widely studied for its cardioprotective effects. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin (81mg daily) for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 50-70 years.

METHODS:
This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 15,000 participants across 50 centers. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either aspirin 81mg daily or matching placebo. Primary endpoint was composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

PARTICIPANTS:
- Age: 50-70 years
- No history of cardiovascular disease
- At least one cardiovascular risk factor
- Exclusion: bleeding disorders, anticoagulant use

RESULTS:
After median follow-up of 5.2 years:
- Primary endpoint occurred in 4.2% of aspirin group vs 5.1% of placebo group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95, p=0.008)
- Major bleeding events: 2.1% aspirin vs 1.2% placebo (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.42-2.16, p<0.001)
- Gastrointestinal bleeding: 1.5% aspirin vs 0.8% placebo
- Intracranial hemorrhage: 0.3% aspirin vs 0.2% placebo

ADVERSE EVENTS:
Most common adverse events in aspirin group:
- Dyspepsia: 12.3%
- Gastrointestinal discomfort: 8.7%
- Easy bruising: 6.2%
- Epistaxis: 4.1%

CONCLUSIONS:
Low-dose aspirin significantly reduced cardiovascular events but increased bleeding risk. The net clinical benefit favors aspirin use in individuals with elevated cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk.

SAFETY PROFILE:
Aspirin was generally well tolerated. Serious adverse events were rare but included major bleeding complications. Regular monitoring recommended for patients on long-term aspirin therapy.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Results support current guidelines recommending aspirin for primary prevention in selected patients aged 50-70 with elevated cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk.
